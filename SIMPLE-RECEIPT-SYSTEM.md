## Integration Points

### 1. Driver Dashboard (`app/driver/index.tsx`)

import { SimpleDeliveryReceipt } from '../../components/SimpleDeliveryReceipt';

// Use after delivery completion
<SimpleDeliveryReceipt
  order={completedOrder}
  driverName={driverName}
  onReceiptSent={() => handleReceiptSent()}
/>
```

### 2. Admin Order Management
```tsx
import { simpleReceiptService } from '../../services/simpleReceiptService';

// Send receipt programmatically
const sendReceipt = async (order, driverName) => {
  const receiptData = simpleReceiptService.extractReceiptDataFromOrder(order, driverName);
  const result = await simpleReceiptService.sendDeliveryReceipt(receiptData);
  // Handle result
};
```
